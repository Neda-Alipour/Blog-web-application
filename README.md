Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a Blog web application using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. The application will allow users to create and view blog posts.

3. Styling: The application should be well-styled and responsive, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices

Technical Requirements

2. EJS: EJS will be used as the templating engine to generate dynamic HTML based on the application's state.
